# Villagers Together
Community driven minecraft ressource pack

This ressource pack change villagers.
Anyone can submit files to be added to the pack. Simply open an issue where you'll upload the files (Everything in a .zip is prefered)
They just need to follow some requirement:

### Textures
- Skins should be from your creations, please don't submit skin from your favorite youtuber :)
- This pack use my "[Villagers to Player](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/villagers-to-player)" model. It has animations like Fresh animation, you optionally can have breast if you'd like, capes (up to 4) and also hat on your characters (same hat as farmer and fishermen)
- Send a regular skin file (as you would upload to put on your player), I will do the modifications, but you need to specify if you want breast.
- *Optional: You also will need to send capes textures to put on your skin (if you want and official mojang cape, just tell the name of it) (possible up to 4, they will show at random in game)
- *Optional: If you want a hat, also send the file. (Use the vanilla job textures to match either the farme or fisherman ones) (will always show in game)
- Rename the skin buy the name you want. In game you'll acces this texture by renaming the entity.
- Non renamed entity will all have the same chance to get on of all the pack textures

### Sounds (optional)
- You can record sounds (Villagers have "ambient" "yes" "no" "hurt" "trade" sounds)
- These sounds should'nt be more that 3 or 4 seconds! (from my testing this is best when it's just a short line like "hello" "howdy"... Full long phrases don't work as they overlap with others)
- You don't need to cover all the type of sounds, and I guess a 10 files per type limitation should be enough (sounds make the pack go big very quick...)
- Rename the sounds files as what they reflect (ambient1, ambient2, yes1....) but put them in a folder with the custom name corresponding
- You can have your sound matching several textures, just specify it in the issue with the name of all the textures
- Don't send sounds ripped from films/videos/music
- Either record your voice (or you're friend's) or use an AI generator
- If you record, try to get a clear sound result (no TV, music or crying kid in the background :D )
- You're fine to send .mp3, but minecraft needs .ogg in mono, as for the textures I'll appreciate if you send it this way already

- as my other pack I'll do an "addon" to support guard villagers and straw statues (and maybe more in the future)

This pack is hosted on both Modrinth and Planet Minecraft
